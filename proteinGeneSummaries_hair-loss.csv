"hair-loss","GJB2","This gene encodes a member of the gap junction protein family. The gap junctions were first characterized by electron microscopy as regionally specialized structures on plasma membranes of contacting adherent cells. These structures were shown to consist of cell-to-cell channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells. The gap junction proteins, also known as connexins, purified from fractions of enriched gap junctions from different tissues differ. According to sequence similarities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, the gap junction proteins are divided into two categories, alpha and beta. Mutations in this gene are responsible for as much as 50% of pre-lingual, recessive deafness.

Diseases associated with GJB2 include Vohwinkel Syndrome and Keratoderma, Palmoplantar, With Deafness.                                            Among its related pathways are Transport of connexins along the secretory pathway and Development Slit-Robo signaling.                                            Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include gap junction channel activity.                                            An important paralog of this gene is GJB6.","Structural component of gap junctions (PubMed:17551008, PubMed:19340074, PubMed:21094651, PubMed:26753910, PubMed:16849369, PubMed:19384972). Gap junctions are dodecameric channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. They are formed by the docking of two hexameric hemichannels, one from each cell membrane (PubMed:17551008, PubMed:19340074, PubMed:21094651, PubMed:26753910). Small molecules and ions diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell via the central pore (PubMed:21094651, PubMed:16849369, PubMed:19384972).
